# Softlinks

Your wiki should be an interconnected web of pages. SpaceWiki thinks this is
such a great idea that there are actually *two* kinds of links!  Hard links are
the first kind which are denoted with the [[square brackets]] when editing. They
direct the reader to a specific page and leave little to the imagination.

Softlinks are different. A softlink is your footprint; a suggestion of direction
taken long ago. A whispered treasure map kept between the pages.

Softlinks are a unique feature of SpaceWiki. They act as a kind of organically
created site map, linking related pages together based on what pages are
"nearby". They're mostly ephemeral and automatic but can be coerced into our
world for your bidding. The easiest way to create a softlink is by clicking on a
hardlink. A new softlink is created automatically at both ends on the original
page and the linked page. The other way to create a softlink is to find
something for through the search box.

By creating softlinks, you are acting as a librarian for the wiki by helping to
categorize, organize, and connect all the information on the wiki. Soft links go
a long way towards making this wiki searchable and infinitely more useful.

Creating a softlink is anonymous, like voting.
